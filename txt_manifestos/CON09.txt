bring economic growth at home and abroad.

ROUTEMAP FOR
ECONOMIC RECOVERY
  Free markets and free trade are the basis of wealth creation, providing the essential
  framework for enterprise and opportunity. We believe that the right role for the
  European Union in the downturn is to ensure that, first, its achievements in free trade
  and markets are sustained and built on, and that further unaffordable burdens are
  not foisted on business; second, that it aids the return to growth by making trade and
  enterprise across Europe easier; and third, that we advance the knowledge-based
  economy that underpins Europe’s global competitiveness.
  These goals are under threat. The rise of protectionism in Europe, hiding behind the
  name of economic nationalism, and the efforts of some to impose a one-size-fits-all
  social model on Europe’s diverse cultures would stifle innovation and hurt our
  economic recovery. Both are driven by a fear of globalisation and a desire to give easy
  – but false – answers to the difficult challenges the nations of Europe face in the
  downturn.
  Conservative MEPs in Europe will fight against the voices of protection and
  centralisation. There are a range of key issues where the UK needs to keep the
  flexibility to make our own policies in the interests of our country. We will stand
  against further tax harmonisation in Europe, work for better co-operation between
  national financial regulators instead of a European super-regulator, and aim to restore
  national control over our social and employment legislation. And a Conservative
  Government will not join the euro, so we can carry on setting interest rates in our own
  economic interests.

                                                           that hinders the UK’s competitiveness by
                                                           imposing heavy regulatory costs on business.
                                                           These are costs we cannot afford in the

  The EU has taken the lead on action to deal with climate change and other

  Delivering a greener society is a progressive goal that Conservatives are

  Conservatives have consistently supported and strengthened the EU climate

  should be watered down in the light of the global economic downturn. Instead,

A TRANSPARENT
AND ACCOUNTABLE
EUROPE THAT
COSTS LESS
  The Conservatives are committed to Britain’s membership of the EU. We are proud
  of the EU’s achievements, such as the progress made in widening the freedom to do
  business, travel and find work, and in anchoring democracy and stability across the
  continent. But we are equally clear that the EU needs to change if it is to be fit for
  the challenges of the new century, not stuck arguing over the debris of the last.
  The modern world places a premium on diversity over uniformity. It forces a focus on
  results over procedures. The old, rigid, ever-centralising EU model is out of date. The
  European Union must make itself relevant by giving its peoples the freedom and
  flexibility they need to deal with the complex and varied challenges we face.
  We believe in a Europe where nations can work together to achieve goals they
  cannot attain on their own, with decisions taken at a level as close as possible to
  the people they affect. It is a basic political truth that lasting political institutions can
  only be built with the people’s consent, and it is on that basis that we want to see
  the European Union develop.

  The UK’s ability to project our values and advance our interests is enhanced by
  membership of international organisations, including the European Union. As the
  world’s largest trading bloc the EU’s trade policies have a significant impact on
  global development, as does its handling of the substantial quantities of aid it
  dispenses. And the EU’s enlargement policy has been highly successful, facilitating
  the transformation of countries across Europe for the better over the past thirty
  years.
  When used well and wisely, the EU’s global reach can be employed not just for
  national and European interests but to achieve ambitious goals such as the
  alleviation of global poverty. The EU is most effective when it is open to the world
  beyond its borders and has the political will and focus to deliver results. It is at its
  most counterproductive when inward-looking ‘fortress Europe’ policies are pursued,
  or political and institutional grandstanding fails to engage with the world’s realities.
