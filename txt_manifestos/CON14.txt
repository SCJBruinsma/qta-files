CONSERVATIVE PRIORITIES
FOR EUROPE
  Here are some of the key changes we will fight for:
  ●   Powers flowing away from Brussels, not to it, and cutting the cost of EU
      administration.
  ●   National parliaments able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.
  ●   Businesses liberated from red tape and benefiting from the strength of the EU’s own
      market – the biggest and wealthiest on the planet – to open up greater free trade
      with North America and Asia.
  ●   Our police forces and justice systems able to protect British citizens, unencumbered
      by unnecessary interference from the European institutions, including the European
      Court of Human Rights.
  ●   Free movement to take up work, not a freedom to move just for more generous
      benefits.
  ●   Support for the continued enlargement of the EU to new members, but with new
      mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the continent.
  ●   End our commitment to an ‘ever closer union,’ as enshrined in the Treaty, to which
      every EU country has to sign up. It may appeal to some countries. But it is not right
      for Britain, and we must ensure we are no longer subject to it.
