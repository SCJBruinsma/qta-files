   PRESERVING THE PLANET
   Climate change, more than almost any
   other issue, demonstrates the need for
   cross continental and global co-operation.
   No one country can solve this great
   challenge alone.
   And the challenge is greater than it has
   ever been. In 2013, the amount of carbon
   dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere passed
   400 parts per million for the first time
   in three million years. Weather events
   once considered extreme are now regular,

DEFENDING
PUBLIC SERVICES
Health and social care
The privatisation of the NHS will possibly be the worst
legacy of this government. Cuts to local councils have
hit social care hard, with many counties and cities now
struggling to provide the care that disabled people and
vulnerable elderly people need. Home visits have in many
regions been cut to a few minutes a day. Day care centres
have often introduced charges, meaning the less well-off
are priced out. Whilst these policies are a consequence of
decisions at Westminster and in local government, there are
ways in which Europe is relevant.
Green MEPs will:

     whilst recognising Europe’s multi-faith history.
   Stateless nations and minority languages
   Europe is scattered with nations with no states and
   languages which are minorities in their own homes.
   Some of those nations are largely settled in their current
   constitutional arrangements. Many have significant
   movements for more autonomy or national independence.
   Whatever the views of these peoples on national
   self-government, they have their own cultures and, in many
   cases, their own languages. It is important that these are
   protected.
   Green MEPs will:
   For stateless nations
   • Support the Council of Europe Framework Convention for
     the Protection of National Minorities and push the UK
     government to recognise the Cornish people as a minority
     nation.
   • Defend the rights of nations to self determination,
     including supporting increased autonomy for nations
     within the EU where they seek it.
   • Defend cultural rights of stateless nations.
   For newly independent states
   • Continue to join with our Scottish sister party in
     supporting Scottish independence because government
     ought to be closer to people.
   • Stand up for the right of Catalan people to self determina-
     tion, through a referendum as set by their assembly, as
     recognised by the UN charter.
   • Push for assurances that where constituent nations of
     member states (for example Scotland or Catalonia) vote
     to become independent states, their governments will
     be permitted to remain within the EU at least until the
     completion of negotiations of the terms of their ongoing
     membership, and will not be forced to enter into the Euro
     unless they so choose. Green MEPs will work to ensure
     smooth accession processes on good terms in any such
     circumstances.
