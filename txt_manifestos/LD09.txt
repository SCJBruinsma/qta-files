     Times are tough in Britain. The recession is hitting people and families hard: tens of
     thousands losing their jobs, businesses going to the wall, and every week hundreds
     losing their homes.

     countries about how he had ended “boom and bust” but he encouraged the debt

You can’t tackle these things without working with other countries, and that’s what
Liberal Democrats will do. It’s how to make Britain strong again.
This election is a big choice for Britain. We can turn away from our friends in Europe
and face the economic storm, climate change, rising crime and terrorism alone. Or
we can choose to work with our allies for a safer, stronger world. For Liberal
Democrats the decision is simple. Britain should lead in Europe, making our country
stronger and more prosperous, championing a brighter, safer future at home and
abroad.
Conservatives and Labour have messed up Britain’s relationship with other
European countries.        Labour has been arrogant, refusing to engage.           The
Conservatives and UKIP just hate the idea of co-operating with people from other
countries, even though that makes life harder for people in Britain. David Cameron
has already isolated himself in Europe by pledging to stop co-operating in the
European Parliament with the parties of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicholas Sarkozy. Imagine how bad it would get if he was in
charge of all Britain’s European relationships.
Liberal Democrats believe in European co-operation. We will get a better deal for
British families, working hard in the European Union to deliver practical help to ease
the burden on people at home. By using our influence we can reduce telephone and
heating bills. We can pioneer projects that generate green jobs - like building
renewable energy networks and low carbon homes. And we can guarantee a fair
deal for our businesses and industries, not least farming and fishing, so that they
survive this downturn.
Rebuilding the economy and protecting the environment aren’t the only tests we’re
facing. Liberal Democrats will work in Europe to help protect Britain from terrorists
and criminals who operate across national borders. And we’ll use our influence as a
part of the European Union to help build a more stable, peaceful world.
Of course the EU needs to change. A lot of money is wasted on out-of-date policies
and structures. The EU should concentrate on big issues and not get involved when
national or regional action would be more effective. Liberal Democrats support the
Lisbon Treaty because it will help do that, making the EU more efficient and
accountable. But Britain will only win the case in Brussels for a flexible, democratic
Europe if we settle our arguments at home on whether we should be part of the EU
or not. That is why Liberal Democrats have argued for a referendum on whether
Britain stays in or leaves the EU. We are clear where we stand – you have to be in it
to win it.
                                                                                         3

stronger together, poorer apart
     Britain has always been an outward-looking nation. Turning inwards, away from
     Europe at this crucial time would only make matters worse. This is our chance to
     build a liberal Europe with Britain at its heart – providing jobs for people in Britain,
     security against international crime, and a greener economy for the future.
     The European Union remains our best bet: safety in numbers in an unsafe world. It's
     our best bet to push forward the international institutions needed to regulate global
     capitalism; our best bet to promote peace, democracy and human rights across the
     world; our best bet to secure global agreements to stop dangerous climate change.
     Britain can only be strong in the world if we are strong in Europe
     That's what Liberal Democrat MEPs are fighting for, day by day, on our behalf. That
     is what the Liberal Democrat MEPs you elect on 4th June will work to achieve - a
     stronger, confident and liberal Europe, delivering real benefits for the people of
     Britain.

stronger together, poorer apart
         executive summary
     We can’t tackle all of Britain’s problems alone. It’s clearer than ever that our fate is
     closely tied to what happens in other countries. In addition to the global economic
     crisis, there’s climate change, international crime, people-trafficking and terrorism, all
     of which cross borders.
     The recession is taking its toll on businesses, people and families throughout Britain.
     Many people face losing their jobs, their livelihoods and their homes.
     The health of our economy is linked as
     never before to the health of those we         “catch criminals,
     trade with in Europe and beyond. It is
     essential that we work urgently with
                                                                    more jobs,
     other European countries to help us all
     pull through recession.
                                                    stop climate change.”
     Conservatives and Labour when in government have messed up Britain’s
     relationship with other European countries. Labour has been arrogant, refusing to
     engage with other European countries because Gordon Brown thought he had all the
     answers himself. The Conservatives and UKIP just hate the idea of co-operating
     with people from other countries. They’d rather we were isolated, even though that
     makes life harder for people in Britain.

This election is a big choice for Britain. We can turn away from our friends in Europe
and face the economic storm, climate change, rising crime and the threat of terrorism
alone. Or we can choose to work together with our allies for a safer, stronger world,
from which we will all benefit.
For Liberal Democrats the decision is simple. Britain can and should lead in Europe,
making our country stronger and more prosperous, championing a brighter, safer
future both at home and abroad. It’s how to make Britain strong again.
The Liberal Democrats will work through the European Union to ensure:
•       A stronger economy, more jobs and more opportunity for businesses;
•       More action to stop climate change and protect the environment;
•       More criminals are caught, such as terrorists, gangsters and
        paedophiles, and our civil liberties are upheld.
Britain’s Liberal Democrat MEPs play a leading role in the wider group of the Alliance
of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) which is the powerful third force in the
Parliament, often casting decisive votes.
Liberal Democrats will:
•       Put money in people’s pockets with big, permanent tax cuts for ordinary
        people and families, funded by closing loopholes and unfair exemptions that
        benefit big business and the wealthy. There is a growing problem of
        companies and banks using offshore financial centres and other means to
        avoid paying their fair share in tax. This can only be stopped if EU countries
        co-ordinate better and are stricter at cracking down on offshore centres.
•       Create more jobs and chart a green road out of recession. The Liberal
        Democrats will work with our European neighbours to create thousands of
        new jobs by breaking down trade barriers across Europe and boosting
        support for green jobs. Liberal Democrats want to create new jobs in green
        industries, put money in people’s pockets from saving energy, and build a
        transport network we can all be proud of. We will encourage other European
        countries to put in place similar investments to ensure we emerge from
        recession stronger and greener than before.
                                                                                           7

stronger together, poorer apart
     •      Make banks work for us. British banks are inextricably bound up with
            banking systems across Europe. We must work together to keep an eye on
            how banks are operating across Europe and get a grip on the behaviour of
            credit institutions. We want more co-operation in Europe between national
            financial services authorities and the European Central Bank.
     •      Catch criminals, sex offenders and terrorists. Our MEPs support greater
            co-operation between police forces such as the European Arrest Warrant that
            helps Britain swiftly bring back suspects to face justice in this country rather
            than wait for the old lengthy extradition procedures.
     •      Protect privacy and human rights.               We need guaranteed privacy
            safeguards on access to databases by police and intelligence agencies,
            including when access is given to non-EU countries such as the US.
     •      Ensure green, affordable and secure energy supplies. Britain has the
            potential to lead the world in clean renewable energy particularly wave, tidal
            and wind power. Our goal is for Britain to source all energy needs from within
            the EU by 2030 and become a net exporter of energy by 2050. This will
            deliver secure supplies of cleaner energy - and lower bills.
     •      Promote free and fair world trade. The EU should promote a world trading
            system that is both free and fair. That means a liberal and open system that
            increases economic growth and jobs, but that takes account of environmental
            and social standards too. The EU has a key role to play in salvaging the
            Doha development round of the World Trade Organisation, including
            eliminating trade barriers and production subsidies in agriculture.
     •      Get a fair deal for shoppers and holidaymakers. We want to open markets
            in Europe and force down the costs of everything from medicines to mobile
            phone bills, meals and machinery. Liberal Democrats stood up for millions of
            British holidaymakers by slashing mobile phone roaming charges, blacklisting
            unsafe airlines, and introducing flight delay refunds. We will continue to fight
            for a better deal for Britain’s consumers.
     •      Replace the Common Agricultural Policy with a new policy that
            strengthens agriculture ensures fair trade for farmers and delivers sustainable
            development of the countryside. This would help farmers to get a fair price for
            their produce, encourage home-grown food, conserve our countryside, help
            rural economies, help tackle climate change and ensure cleaner water and
            protect water supplies.

• Reform the EU budget to get better value for money. The EU budget is in
  urgent need of wholesale reform so that money is spent only on the things the
  EU really needs to do.
• Boost military capabilities to make a stronger European contribution to
  NATO and to give Europe the capability to act when it needs to. Liberal
  Democrats say no to a European army, but yes to European defence co-
  operation. We want a strong Europe within an effective NATO. We believe
  that NATO remains the bedrock of our collective security.
